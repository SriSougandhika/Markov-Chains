# Markov-Chains ⛓️
 In this project, I explored how simple probabilistic models can create surprisingly smart predictions and creative outputs using Markov Chains 🤖.

## What's Inside?
I implemented five fun and insightful tasks using Markov Chains:

- 🌤️ **Weather Prediction:** Predict the next day’s weather (Sunny, Rainy, etc.) based on previous patterns using a transition matrix.
- 📈 **Stock Movement Prediction:** Forecast simple stock movement trends like "Up", "Down", "Stable" using historical patterns.
- 📜 **Text Generation:** Generate new text that mimics a given writing style by learning the likelihood of one word following another.
- 🎵 **Song Lyrics Generation:** Train on real song lyrics and generate new, unique lines with similar structure and vibe.
- 🗞️ **News Headline Generation:** Create news-like headlines based on patterns from actual headlines — catchy and fun!

## How It Works?
Markov Chains are models that predict the next state based only on the current state — not the full history.
It’s like guessing what happens next by only looking at what’s happening right now.

Example:
If it's sunny today and it usually rains 70% of the time after a sunny day, then there's a 70% chance it'll rain tomorrow. Simple! ☀️➡️🌧️

## Requirements
